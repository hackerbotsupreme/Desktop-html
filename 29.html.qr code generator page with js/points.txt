    1.how do i center the element without  setting the height and the width to 100% 
    body{
        background: #262a2f;

    }
    .container{
        width: 400px;
        padding: 25px 35px;
        position: absolute;
        top: 50%;
        left: 50%;
        transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
        /* the combination of top left and transform is used to center this element to the screen. */
        background: #fff;
        border-radius: 10px;
    }
    here we didn't actually  make the body a container but still  its on the middle.

    3. using of max-height in #img-box
        what could be the reason of using max-height here  instead of  only height ?
        ChatGPT
        The use of max-height instead of height in the provided code snippet suggests that the height of the #imgbox element needs to be flexible and can vary based on its content.

        By using max-height, the element can dynamically adjust its height based on the size of the content it contains, up to a maximum height specified by the max-height value. This approach allows for a responsive design where the element can accommodate different content sizes without overflowing or distorting the layout.

        Here are a few reasons why max-height might be preferred over height in this context:

        Content flexibility: Using max-height allows the element to adjust its height based on the size of the content within it. If the content is larger, the #imgbox element will expand vertically to accommodate it. This is useful when the content can vary in size or is dynamically generated.

        Responsive design: By using max-height, the element can respond to different screen sizes and maintain its aspect ratio. This is particularly important for responsive layouts where the element needs to adapt to various screen dimensions.

        Smooth transitions: The transition property specified for max-height (transition: max-height 1s;) enables smooth and animated transitions when the max-height value changes. This can create a visually pleasing effect when the element expands or collapses.

        In summary, using max-height instead of height allows the #imgbox element to be flexible, responsive, and capable of accommodating varying content sizes while still maintaining a smooth transition effect.
