3.what does 'transform: translate(-50%, -50%)' this line implies ?
    The transform: translate(-50%, -50%) CSS rule is used to horizontally and vertically center an element within its parent container. Let's break down what each part of the rule implies:

    transform: This CSS property allows you to apply transformations to an element, such as scaling, rotating, and translating.
    translate(): This is a transformation function within the transform property. It allows you to move an element along the X and Y axes.
    In the case of translate(-50%, -50%):

    The first value -50% represents the horizontal translation. By setting it to -50%, the element is moved leftwards by 50% of its own width

5.background-position: 1900px 0;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
why we are needing to set
background-repeat:no-repeat
when we have already set the position differently ?


    Setting background-repeat: no-repeat ensures that the background image is not repeated or tiled within its container. By default, if background-repeat is not specified, the background image will repeat both horizontally and vertically to cover the entire container.

    In the given example, background-position: 1900px 0; specifies the starting position of the background image. However, without background-repeat: no-repeat, the image would repeat horizontally if the container is wider than the background image's width.

    By explicitly setting background-repeat: no-repeat, you ensure that the background image is only displayed once at the specified position and not repeated. This is particularly useful when you want to display a decorative or distinctive background image that shouldn't be tiled or repeated.
